# NN-over-MNIST-Dataset
Processing MNIST dataset using Neural Network. I have taken inspiration from Andrew NG's deep learning course on how to build your own deep learning neural network without Tensorflow. 

This is a 2 layer NN with 1 hidden layer. The first activation layer is relu, output layer is sigmoid.
